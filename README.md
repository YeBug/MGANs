This repository contains code for the paper "Multi-task GANs for View-specific Feature Learning in Gait Recognition"

## Install

To run the code, you will need:

- PyTorch (likely version 0.2.0 with GPU support)
- Matlab and Python(likely version 3.6.1)


## Building PEI

Please run “./pei/demoPEI.m” to build a PEI example.

## Training MGANs

We provide source code to train and test MGANs model.

Please prepare the training data as .mat file first and then run the .ipynb file.

Models will be auto-saved in “./mgans/model”.
